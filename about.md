Hey folks, I'm Andres. I'm a software engineer that enjoys working 
on large-scale projects, whether that scale be from handling hundreds of thousands
of RPS reliably or affecting changes across large engineering orgs.


Currently, I'm a Staff Engineer at [Stripe](https://stripe.com) leading the alerting &amp; 
stream processing sides of Observability. 


When I'm not trying to write half decent code I enjoy:


* Weight lifting
* Kayaking
* Cooking
* Reading
* Hanging out with my dog
